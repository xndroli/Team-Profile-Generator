## üîó Description <a name = "description"></a>

This week, I'll build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, I will also write unit tests for each part of my code and ensure that it passes all of them.

Because this application is not deployed, I will also provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing.

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
